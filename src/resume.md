## Overview
I'm a highly detailed profile, oriented not only to results related to mobile development but also to management, technical and leadership commitment.

I'm usually part of each phase involved in software development, including the analysis of new features or changes, the detection and management of risks, the design of the architecture and the development itself. Quality is a key during this process.

On the soft side, I find both communication and proactivity as some of my most valuable skills. I do believe in earning trust by showing loyalty to what it's important to the business. I'm also focused on ensuring every policy, procedure and development standard. My goal is to always show flexibility to respond to every single needs of the business.
